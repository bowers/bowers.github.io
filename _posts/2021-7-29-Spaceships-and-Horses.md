title: The Spaceship and the Horse

We've got IT modernization all wrong.

The future, [as everyone tells us](https://servicepath.co/2021/04/the-future-of-digital-transformation-accenture-deloitte-and-mckinsey/), is about digital transformation.  The modern way to do things is no-code, serverless, and [cloud-native](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md). Anything not run by DevSecOps on Kubernetes is [technical debt](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html). Since [every company is now a tech company](https://www.wsj.com/articles/every-company-is-now-a-tech-company-1543901207), you should modernize by migrating from your old, legacy systems into modern platforms architected using cutting-edge technology.

What you've got are horses. Legacy systems. Old. Kludgy. Manual.  Ugly stuff like [40-year-old mainframes running COBOL](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/new-jersey-seeks-cobol-programmers-to-fix-unemployment-system.html), and [airline check-in systems still running Windows XP](https://japantoday.com/category/tech/skymark-airlines-still-using-windows-xp). [It's an embarrassment!](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/drill-cobol-really-needs-go-dave-johnston/)
[Replace everything legacy now!](https://devsquad.com/blog/7-reasons-you-should-replace-that-legacy-software-asap/)

What you need are spaceships.  Modern. New. Agile. Automated.  Ditch the mainframe and go with [serverless COBOL](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/serverless-cobol-rejuvenating-legacy-code-with-open-source-software/). Put Kubernetes [in everything](https://gcn.com/articles/2020/01/07/af-kubernetes-f16.aspx). Add voice-activated artificial intelligence to [your toilet](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/kohler-numi-alexa-toilet,news-28957.html).

You're way behind, because everyone else is already using nothing but spaceships, while you're moseying along with your old horses. 

In your defense, you're probably in the midst of rolling out one or two spaceships of your own. Those marquee, CEO-inspired projects.  Visionary transformations.   Like your "2020 Vision" project, which sounded way cooler back in 2017, but now just reminds everyone that you're on year 5 of the 2-year rollout.  And shhhhh, you're not supposed to admit that you're just replacing an inadequate legacy system with an inadequate modern system.

So you feel bad.  And embarrassed.  And alone.

Well, don't.  You've been duped into a false choice between "spaceships" and "horses".

Spaceships should be visionary, groundbreaking...and extremely rare.  Spaceships fail a lot, but that's a feature, not a bug:  Building spaceships is about learning, not really about reaching the destination.  Also, the technology and skills for building spaceships is spread very unequally.

![Horses](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/wild-horses.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1)

And those legacy systems, the horses?  You know, the stuff that works, that's well understood.  Your organization is filled with institutional knowledge about how to use your legacy systems. Everyone knows what they can do, and they know what they can't. For the most part, they get their job done.  

By the way, labeling your system "legacy" is actually a modern thing to do. The first known use of the word "legacy" as an adjective, as in "legacy system," [was in 1984] (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legacy).  .

Yes, some horses should be replaced.  Yes, you should take advantage of some new, modern technology.  But here's the kicker: You don't modernize by replacing horses with spaceships.  You modernize by managing the dependencies you have on your legacy systems as you roll out new technology.  Most of your horses should be adequately maintained and appreciated. Modernization is about peaceful coexistence between spaceships and horses, not about ditching all the horses. 

After all, the country that has the most spaceships today [also has the most horses](https://www.bluemarblecitizen.com/rankings/top-horse-countries). 

So abandon the false choice of "modern" vs. "legacy."  They're not in conflict.  You need both.  Success comes from building the skills to integrate modern and legacy together.
